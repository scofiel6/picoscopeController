# PicoScope Support Toolbox

The PicoScope Support Toolbox provides a set of classes and functions for use with Pico Technology Instrument Drivers or calling the shared library Application Protocol Interface (API) functions directly from MATLAB when communicating with PicoScope<sup>Â®</sup> PC Oscilloscopes. 
This toolbox contains Help documentation that can be accessed via the Documentation page in the MATLAB Help menu.

Users downloading the zip file will need to add the root folder and sub-folders to the MATLAB path.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for Microsoft Windows or Linux operating systems (64-bit).

**Notes:**

* MATLAB 2015b is recommended for 32-bit versions of MATLAB on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

### Installing the PicoScope Support Toolbox files

We recommend using the [Add-Ons Explorer](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) in MATLAB in order to install these files and obtain updates.

If your version of MATLAB does not have the Add-Ons Explorer, download the zip file from the [MATLAB Central File Exchange page](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53681-picoscope-support-toolbox)
 and add the root and sub-folders to the MATLAB path.
